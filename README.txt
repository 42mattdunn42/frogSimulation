This is a project inspired by the video found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLTyX4zL2Fc
I initially wrote the Java program as a way to understand the problem, and then refined
  the project in a python version, each found in their respective branch.
Finally, I put data into excel and was able to fit a logarithmic function to the results.
